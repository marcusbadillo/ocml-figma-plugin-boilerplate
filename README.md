# OCML Figma Plugin Boilerplate

> This repository is experimental and will be migrated to OC Media Lab once stabilized.

A minimal, production-ready boilerplate for building **Figma plugins** at [OC Media Lab](https://ocmedialab.com) using **TypeScript**, **ESM**, and **esbuild**. This repository establishes a clean, repeatable foundation for all OCML Figma plugins, with strict boundaries enforced by the Figma runtime.
